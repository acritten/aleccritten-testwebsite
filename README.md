Hello! I am Alec Critten. I recently graduated from the University of Vermont, majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science. Some of my main areas of interest past and present are post-quantum cryptography, formal methods, and various areas of pure mathematics.

From 2020-21, I wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on the RLWE cryptosystem advised by Dr. Christelle Vincent in Vermont - [here](https://github.com/acritten/acritten.github.io/files/6666993/Alec.Critten.-.Undergraduate.Honors.Thesis.Final.Version.April.29.2021.pdf) is a link to the thesis document and [here](https://github.com/acritten/acritten.github.io/files/6667016/Alec.Critten.-.Thesis.Presentation.April.13.pdf) is a presentation I gave in its defense.

Outside of technical interests, you'll often find me in my free time working on music, writing about music, or doing my best to study foreign languages (currently Japanese though I may pursue Spanish or French in the future). [Here](https://acritten.bandcamp.com/)'s my Bandcamp (a fairly prolific exploration of ambient soundscapes and experimental electronic textures), and [here](https://www.sputnikmusic.com/user/eureka) is my SputnikMusic account where I publish record reviews. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acritten/).
